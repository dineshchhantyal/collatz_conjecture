## Collatz Conjecture Solver

### Overview
This Python script is designed to explore the famous Collatz Conjecture. The Collatz Conjecture, also known as the 3n + 1 conjecture, is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n, then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture posits that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

### Requirements
Python 3.x

### Usage
1. Open main.py.
2. Change the value of SEED to any positive integer from which you want to start the Collatz sequence exploration.
3. Run the script using the command:
```bash
python main.py
```

The script will print out each subsequent node in the Collatz sequence until it reaches 1.
Additionally, you can view all corresponding nodes in the data.json file generated by the script.
Example
``` python
# Change SEED to any positive integer
SEED = 10

# Run the script
python main.py
```

### Files
main.py: Python script to generate and print the Collatz sequence.
data.json: JSON file containing all the nodes and their corresponding values in the Collatz sequence.
